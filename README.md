## Inspiration

With COVID-19 causing all school activities to become virtual, it is harder for high schoolers to gain access to the resources and information necessary for school organizations and clubs. This can be especially challenging for freshmen or new-comers who want to learn about what activities or clubs their high school has. 

## What it does

ClubHub is a user-friendly platform for students to find the club that fits their interests and for clubs to connect with one another. We want to help students maintain social involvement in high school, especially during COVID-19, when everything has gone completely virtual. Despite being physically separated, our web app provides a way for students across the nation to build communities, share ideas, and collaborate. 

## How I built it

We built the ClubHub web application using:

1) React

2) Typescript

3) Recoil 

## Challenges I ran into

We had trouble connecting to Firebase, so we decided to focus on the client-side of the web application. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We are proud of figuring out how to implement Recoil to pass values from the different components. 

## What I learned

We learned that front-end is not easy, as we are all mostly familiar with back-end. 

## What's next for ClubBuds

We hope to add more filter options, tags, and improve the design of the web application.
